## AI Update Instructions

### When to Update This File
- **First-time setup**: When author describes their project for the first time
- **Goal changes**: When author explicitly changes or adds objectives
- **Scope changes**: When project scope is redefined
- **Vision shifts**: When the creative direction evolves
- **Author request**: When author asks to update goals

### How to Update
1. Ask author for clarification if goals are ambiguous
2. Fill in relevant sections based on author's description
3. Keep language clear and concise
4. Preserve author's intent and wording when possible
5. Leave sections blank if information not provided (don't make assumptions)
6. For fiction: Focus on story elements, characters, themes
7. For non-fiction: Focus on argument, research, structure

### What NOT to Do
- Don't invent goals the author hasn't mentioned
- Don't change goals without author confirmation
- Don't add technical writing details here (those go in project files)
- Don't duplicate information from progress.md
- Don't impose your own vision on the author's project
