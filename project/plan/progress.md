## AI Update Instructions

### When to Update This File
- **Session save**: When user says "save session" - update with session accomplishments
- **Milestone completion**: When user completes a significant task or milestone
- **Status changes**: When project phase changes or blockers are resolved
- **User request**: When user explicitly asks to update progress

### How to Update
1. **After each session**: Add accomplishments to "Recent Accomplishments"
2. **When tasks complete**: Move from "In Progress" to "Completed Milestones"
3. **Update percentages**: Adjust "Overall Progress" based on completed work
4. **Track blockers**: Add new blockers as they arise, move resolved ones to "Resolved Issues"
5. **Update "Next Steps"**: Keep this current based on what user wants to work on next

### What to Update
- **Current Phase**: Change when project moves to new stage
- **Completed Milestones**: Add entry when major milestone achieved
- **Active Tasks**: Check off completed, add new ones
- **Recent Accomplishments**: Add session accomplishments (keep last 2 weeks)
- **Blockers**: Add/remove/resolve as status changes
- **Next Steps**: Update based on user's stated priorities

### What NOT to Do
- Don't mark tasks complete without user confirmation
- Don't remove blockers unless user confirms they're resolved
- Don't change "Next Steps" without user input
- Don't inflate progress percentages
