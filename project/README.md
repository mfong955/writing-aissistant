# Your Writing Project Workspace

This is your main working area where all your writing project files will be organized by the Writing Assistant.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Resources**: Place any reference materials, research, or inspiration in the `user_resources/` folder
2. **Tell the AI**: Describe what you're writing (novel, essay, article, etc.)
3. **Let AI Organize**: The Writing Assistant will create appropriate folders and files for your project type

## What Gets Created Here

Depending on your project type, the AI will create folders like:

### For Fiction (Novels, Short Stories, Screenplays)
- `characters/` - Character profiles and development
- `settings/` - Locations and world-building
- `plot/` - Story structure, scenes, and outline
- `research/` - Background information and fact-checking
- `drafts/` - Your writing drafts and versions
- `notes/` - Ideas and brainstorming

### For Non-Fiction (Essays, Articles, Books, Memoirs)
- `outline/` - Book/article structure and organization
- `research/` - Background research and sources
- `sources/` - Citations and bibliography
- `drafts/` - Writing drafts and versions
- `notes/` - Ideas and observations
- `interviews/` - Interview transcripts (if applicable)

### For Academic Writing (Papers, Theses, Dissertations)
- `research/` - Literature review and research notes
- `sources/` - Citations and bibliography
- `outline/` - Paper structure
- `drafts/` - Writing drafts and versions
- `data/` - Research data, tables, figures

### For Other Projects
The AI will adapt the structure based on your specific needs.

## Tips for Success

- Say "save session" when you're done to save your progress

## Working with the AI

The Writing Assistant uses different **personas** to help you:

- **Writing Coach** - Encouragement, questioning, overcoming blocks
- **Editor** - Grammar, style, clarity improvements
- **Researcher** - Fact-checking and information gathering
- **Brainstormer** - Idea generation and creative exploration
- **Critic** - Honest feedback and constructive critique

You can request a specific persona: "Can you review this as an editor?" or "I need a writing coach right now."

The AI will automatically adopt the most appropriate persona based on what you're working on.

## Your Writing Journey

This workspace grows with your project. Start by describing what you want to write, and the AI will help you organize, plan, draft, and revise until your project is complete.

Happy writing!
