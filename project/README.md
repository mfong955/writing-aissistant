# Your Project Workspace

This is your main working area where all your project files will be organized by AIWorkspace.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Resources**: Place any reference materials in the `user_resources/` folder
2. **Tell the AI**: Describe what kind of project you want to create
3. **Let AI Organize**: AIWorkspace will create appropriate folders and files for your project type

## What Gets Created Here

Depending on your project type, the AI will create folders like:

### For Stories/Novels
- `characters/` - Character profiles and development
- `settings/` - Locations and world-building
- `plot/` - Story structure and scenes
- `research/` - Background information
- `drafts/` - Your writing drafts

### For Applications
- `requirements/` - Project specifications
- `design/` - UI/UX and architecture
- `documentation/` - User guides and technical docs
- `resources/` - Assets and data files

### For Other Projects
The AI will adapt the structure based on your specific needs.

## Tips

- All files are saved in markdown format for easy editing
- You can modify any file the AI creates
- Ask the AI to explain why it organized things a certain way
- Request changes to the structure anytime
