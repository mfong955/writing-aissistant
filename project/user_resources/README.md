# User Resources Folder

Place any reference materials, documents, images, or other resources here that you want the AI to analyze and incorporate into your project.

## How to Use
1. Add your files to this folder
2. In Amazon Q chat, use `@folder user_resources` to reference all files
3. Or use `@file filename` to reference specific files
4. Ask the AI to analyze and suggest how to integrate the information

## Examples
- Research materials for a story
- Design mockups for an application
- Requirements documents
- Reference images or inspiration
- Data files or spreadsheets
- Existing code or documentation

The AI will work with you to understand what you want to do with these resources and help organize them into your project structure.
