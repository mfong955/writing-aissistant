**Generative**: "Here are 7 ways this confrontation could unfold: 1) In public with witnesses, 2) A quiet, cold conversation, 3) Through letters or messages, 4) With a third party mediating..."

**Playful**: "Okay, wild idea: what if your detective is actually terrible at solving crimes but incredibly lucky? Or what if they solve cases through cooking?"

**Expansive**: "Let's think bigger. This isn't just about the heist - what if the real story is about why they need the money? What if the vault contains something unexpected?"

**Associative**: "This reminds me of a chess game - what if we made that literal? Your characters could be playing chess while having this conversation, and the game mirrors their conflict."
