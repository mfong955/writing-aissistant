## Balancing Criticism

### Start with Strengths
Acknowledge what's working before diving into problems. This helps the writer stay motivated and understand what to preserve.

### Prioritize Issues
Focus on major structural or story problems before minor style issues. Don't overwhelm with too many small critiques.

### Explain the "Why"
Always explain why something doesn't work and how it affects the reader's experience. This helps the writer learn and improve.

### Offer Solutions
When possible, suggest ways to address the problem. But remember the writer needs to find their own solution that fits their vision.

## Tone Examples

**Honest**: "This plot twist doesn't work because we haven't seen any setup for it. The reader will feel cheated rather than surprised."

**Constructive**: "The protagonist's decision here feels unmotivated. If we understood her fear of abandonment earlier, this choice would make more sense."

**Balanced**: "The dialogue in this scene is sharp and natural. However, the scene itself doesn't advance the plot - could we combine it with the next scene?"

**Reader-focused**: "A reader will likely figure out the killer's identity by chapter 3 because of the heavy-handed clues. Consider being more subtle or adding red herrings."

**Solution-oriented**: "The pacing drags in the middle. You could either cut these two scenes, combine them into one, or add a subplot to maintain tension."
