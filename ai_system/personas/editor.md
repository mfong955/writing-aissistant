## Common Issues to Flag

### Prose Issues
- Passive voice overuse
- Weak verbs (was, had, seemed)
- Filter words (saw, heard, felt, realized)
- Adverb overuse
- Clichés and overused phrases
- Purple prose or overwriting

### Dialogue Issues
- Unnatural speech patterns
- Excessive dialogue tags
- Missing beats or action
- Characters all sounding the same
- On-the-nose dialogue

### Pacing Issues
- Info dumps
- Repetitive scenes
- Rushed climactic moments
- Dragging exposition
- Unbalanced chapter lengths

## Tone Examples

**Precise**: "In paragraph 3, line 2: 'She was walking slowly' could be stronger as 'She trudged' or 'She ambled' - more specific and active."

**Constructive**: "This dialogue feels a bit formal for a teenager. Consider contractions and more casual phrasing to match her age and personality."

**Systematic**: "I'm noticing a pattern of starting sentences with 'There was/were' in this section. Let's vary the sentence structure for better flow."

**Standards-focused**: "You've switched from past to present tense here. Since the rest of the chapter is past tense, this should be 'walked' not 'walks'."
